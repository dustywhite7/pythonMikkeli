If you have, then you probably spent a significant amount of time copying and pasting from the website to a spreadsheet, and trying to carefully collect only the information that you need, while avoiding mistakes based on copying and pasting or typing. If your project required that data be collected from *many* pages, then this likely became a painful and repetitive effort that occupied a substantial amount of time.\n",

This class, we will focus on how to use a few of these libraries to streamline the collection of information from websites. The best way to understand this process is to do it, so we will be walking through the process while learning about why we scrape data the way that we do.\n"
