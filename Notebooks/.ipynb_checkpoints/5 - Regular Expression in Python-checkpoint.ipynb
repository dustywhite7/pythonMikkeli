    "## What is Regular Expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with text is HARD. Do we consider \"dog\" to be different from \"dogs\"? How do we explain to a computer if we want those words to be considered the same word? In written language, most rules are not really rules, but patterns within text. Regular expression is a paradigm for describing patterns in text in order to accomodate the flexibility of written language and our attempts to find information within larger bodies of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, I might want to find a series of keywords within a body of text in order to determine whether or not the topic of the text has been correctly identified (or even in order to determine what the topic of the text actually is!). Regular expression has the ability to help express patterns in text that we may want to examine, and the flexibility to determine exactly how we want to capture it. Some common uses of regular expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Validating emails, phone numbers, addresses, and other text blocks\n",
    "- Finding subsets of a document\n",
    "- Determining the presence or count of particular words, phrases or patterns\n",
    "- Web Scraping\n",
    "- Grammar suggestions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are, of course many more ways to use regular expression. Let's start looking at how we can use it in our personal data analysis."

    "\n",
    "Remember, regular expression is way to describe patterns. Below, we will explore how to create various kinds of patterns. To get started, we need to import our regular expression library, called `re`. We can import `re` just like any other library by including the following line of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first function that we will utilize is `re.search`. This function will allow us to search through a string of text in order to try and find patterns of interest. Let's begin by importing some text. We will utilize two chapters (44 and 45) from the Jane Austen novel \"Pride and Prejudice\" (one of my favorites). Below is the code to import these chapters as a (very long) string:"

      "her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently\n",

      "arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the\n",

      "to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a\n",
      "carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in\n",
      "a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing\n",
      "the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her\n",
      "surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she\n",
      "expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment\n",
      "of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many\n",
      "of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on\n",
      "the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that\n",
      "there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a\n",
      "quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these\n",
      "newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of\n",
      "Elizabeth's feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite\n",
      "amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet,\n",
      "she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much\n",
      "in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally\n",
      "suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked\n",
      "up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of\n",
      "inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction\n",
      "took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new\n",
      "acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her\n",
      "being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;\n",
      "but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was\n",
      "only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from\n",
      "her beyond a monosyllable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though\n",
      "little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance\n",
      "womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there\n",
      "was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly\n",
      "unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as\n",
      "acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much\n",
      "relieved by discerning such different feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley\n",
      "was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her\n",
      "satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick\n",
      "step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All\n",
      "Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but had she still\n",
      "felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected\n",
      "cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He\n",
      "inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked\n",
      "and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage\n",
      "than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before\n",
      "them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just\n",
      "arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards\n",
      "each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from\n",
      "those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew\n",
      "what it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little\n",
      "in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was\n",
      "evident enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the\n",
      "feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and\n",
      "to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she\n",
      "feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she\n",
      "endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley\n",
      "was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!\n",
      "how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in\n",
      "a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on\n",
      "former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion\n",
      "that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,\n",
      "though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his\n",
      "behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look\n",
      "appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred\n",
      "between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point\n",
      "she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred\n",
      "ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a\n",
      "recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying\n",
      "more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed\n",
      "to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone\n",
      "which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long time since\n",
      "he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could reply,\n",
      "he added, “It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of\n",
      "November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards\n",

      "_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,\n",
      "nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which\n",
      "gave them meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself;\n",
      "but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general\n",
      "complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed\n",
      "from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that\n",
      "the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however\n",
      "temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When\n",
      "she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion\n",
      "of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a\n",
      "disgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the\n",
      "very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last\n",
      "lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was\n",
      "so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly\n",
      "restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company\n",
      "of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations\n",
      "at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from\n",
      "self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance\n",
      "could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the\n",
      "acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw\n",
      "down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and\n",
      "Rosings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose\n",
      "to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing\n",
      "their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner\n",
      "at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a\n",
      "diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,\n",
      "readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing\n",
      "how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its\n",
      "acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however,\n",
      "that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than\n",
      "any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of\n",
      "society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for\n",
      "her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth\n",
      "again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to\n",
      "make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all\n",
      "this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on\n",
      "this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their\n",
      "visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some\n",
      "satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been\n",
      "little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her\n",
      "uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their\n",
      "favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was\n",
      "not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was\n",
      "much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;\n",
      "it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to\n",
      "interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far\n",
      "as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could\n",
      "not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character\n",
      "from their own feelings and his servant's report, without any reference\n",
      "to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known\n",
      "would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,\n",
      "however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible\n",
      "that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four\n",
      "years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be\n",
      "hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of\n",
      "their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had\n",
      "nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,\n",
      "it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town\n",
      "where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he\n",
      "was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held\n",
      "there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the\n",
      "son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known\n",
      "fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind\n",
      "him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than\n",
      "the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not\n",
      "long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion;\n",
      "and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She\n",
      "certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she\n",
      "had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,\n",
      "that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his\n",
      "valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some\n",
      "time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened\n",
      "into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in\n",
      "his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,\n",
      "which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,\n",
      "there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.\n",
      "It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,\n",
      "but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and\n",
      "acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations\n",
      "accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid\n",
      "her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most\n",
      "eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display\n",
      "of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only\n",
      "were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent\n",
      "on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much\n",
      "pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent\n",
      "love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a\n",
      "sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be\n",
      "exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,\n",
      "she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how\n",
      "far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would\n",
      "be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her\n",
      "fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of\n",
      "his addresses.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that\n",
      "such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on the\n",
      "very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a\n",
      "late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled,\n",
      "by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that\n",
      "it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following\n",
      "morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when\n",
      "she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been\n",

      "\n",
      "On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,\n",

      "opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody\n",

      "In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there\n",
      "with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in\n",

      "all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear\n",
      "of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior\n",
      "the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,\n",
      "however, did her justice, and pitied her.\n",
      "\n",
      "By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and,\n",
      "on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,\n",
      "succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a\n",
      "genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind\n",
      "of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the\n",
      "others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\n",
      "Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she\n",
      "wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a\n",
      "short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,\n",
      "and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without\n",
      "calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her\n",
      "from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an\n",
      "inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity\n",
      "of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every\n",
      "moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she\n",
      "feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\n",
      "she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After\n",
      "sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss\n",

      "inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal\n",
      "indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the\n",
      "entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the\n",
      "finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many\n",
      "a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been\n",
      "given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole\n",

      "beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected\n",
      "them round the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether\n",
      "she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the\n",
      "feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but\n",
      "a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to\n",

      "He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other\n",
      "gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him\n",
      "only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to\n",
      "Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely\n",
      "resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more\n",
      "necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she\n",
      "saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,\n",
      "and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour\n",
      "when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive\n",
      "curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the\n",
      "smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\n",
      "objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions\n",
      "to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's\n",
      "entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he\n",
      "was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded\n",
      "as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss\n",
      "Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the\n",
      "first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:\n",

      "confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what\n",

We will start by looking for the word \"Elizabeth\" (she is the main character of the novel, and is also sometimes called \"Lizzy\" or \"Eliza\"). In order to look for the word \"Elizabeth\", we will use the `re.search` function mentioned earlier. This function takes two arguments: a regular expression, and a string in which to search for matches to that pattern. Regular expression patterns will be stored as strings, as well, but we will use **raw strings**. To create a raw string, we prepend the string with a single letter `r`, so that our string looks something like this: `r''`. \n",

    "What did we just do? A couple things. First, we used the `re.finditer` function, which generates an **iterable**. In order to get back all of our results, we need to create a list by iterating over the results. We used a list comprehension to do that. (Remember that list comprehensions are statements like `[i for i in some_iterable]`). At that point, we had a list of results.

First, we used `()` to encapsulate a portion of the word Elizabeth that may not be present in some cases. Parens (`()`) create **groups** in regular expression. Sometimes we will want to capture groups from within an expression, and other times we will only want to indicate that a group may or may not be present. In this case, we indicate that the sequence `beth` is not strictly required for a match by using a `?` character after the group. This doesn't mean that our text needs to include a `?`. The `?` symbol says \"I want either 1 or 0 matches to the \"beth\" sequence.\n",
