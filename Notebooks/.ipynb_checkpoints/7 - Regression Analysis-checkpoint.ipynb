    "Let's learn about our first statistical modeling technique. Linear regression is sometimes considered the most basic machine learning algorithm. Strictly speaking, this is true; linear regression takes data as an input, and updates its rule set based on that data to model an outcome. This is the basis for machine learning! On the other hand, linear regression as a statistical tool definitely predates the machine learning movement, and has been used for over 200 years. It is well understood, and is readily accepted as a means of analysis.\n",

The big catch with statistical models is statistical models do not successfully identify **causation**. Statistical models instead identify **correlation**, and leave **causation** to domain expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correlation**: a mutual relationship or connection between two or more things. In statistics, we even use measures such as the correlation coefficient to describe the intensity of the relationship between two variables. In order for the relationship between two variables to be a **causal** relationship, there must first be **correlation** between those variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Causation**: the act of causing something. This is the relationship that statistical models want to measure! Unfortunately, statistics alone can't get us to **causation**. In order to establish a **causal** relationship, we must combine correlation between two variables with an explanation of *how* one of those variables can lead to changes in the other."

    "1. Is it possible that $y$ causes $x$ instead?\n",

    "3. Could the relationship have been observed by chance?\n",

    "One way to establish causality is through Randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In the context of an RCT, the experiment is designed such that only one variable is experimented upon. By assigning random individuals (or entities, groups, etc.) to the treatment and control groups, the researcher can use univariate statistical tests to determine the relationship between the variable of interest (called the treatment variable) and the outcome (dependent variable).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "If you have ever created a trend line in Excel or Tableau (or any similar software), then you have implemented a form of regression analysis. The beauty of regression analysis is in its ability to be **more** than just a trend line on a plot. While a trendline is valuable, it is only helpful when describing the relationship between two (and maybe three) variables, regression analysis makes it possible to create the analog to a trendline using **as many variables as you would like** (so long as you have more observations than variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying concept (we won't go into the math here) is that we want to statistically separate the effect of each variable on the outcome. In other words, what happens to our outcome when we vary only one of our many variables at a time? All of the math behind regression analysis is designed to answer this question. This means that regression analysis\n",

Not only can we understand the impact of each individual variable, but we can also forecast the dependent variable for use in predictive modeling.\n",

    "- **Standard Error (Standard Deviation)**: Measures how noisy the effect of the independent variable is on the dependent variable\n",
    "    - Larger numbers indicate more noise\n",
    "- **Confidence Interval**: Assuming our regression analysis includes all relevant information, we expect that the true coefficient (treatment effect) lies within this range 95% of the time (for a 95% confidence interval)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Regression Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the statistical models underlying linear regression depend on several assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Effects are Linear (there are some workarounds)\n",
    "2. Errors are normally distributed (bell-shaped)\n",
    "3. Variables are not Collinear\n",
    "4. No Autocorrelation (problematic for time series data)\n",
    "5. Homoskedasticity (errors are shaped the same across all observations)\n",
    "\n",
    "While the study of these assumptions is essential for a practitioner, and frequently occupies an entire semester-long course, it is sufficient for us to state these assumptions, and be aware of the fact that these assumptions are baked into the models. It is equally important to know that adaptations of regression analysis exist to work around violations of each assumption where needed.\n",

Regressions are very powerful transparent models, by which I mean that it is straightforward to see how each variable leads to the predicted outcome. Whenever we want to establish causality (and can't put together an RCT), regression models are the *de facto* standard for understanding how one variable causes the other to change.\n",

This could be a model of the amount of profit generated through various business practices, the population density of a region, or any other metric that can be measured on a more or less continuous scale. Less frequently, linear regression is used to model outcomes that represent discrete outcomes such as success or failure, or to model the probability of success or failure. This is called a **linear probability model (LPM)**.\n",

A probability is a measure of likelihood, and is typically measured on the scale of $[0,1]$, or from 0% to 100% probability. A probability of 0 (0%) indicates that there is no likelihood that an event will take place. On the other hand, a probability of 1 (100%) would suggest absolute certainty that an outcome will occur. The important point, no matter which measurement of probability we choose to use, is that probabilities are **bounded** (cannot go beyond) absolute certainty of failure or absolute certainty of success.\n",

But first, let's explore why it is an improvement over LPMs. Remember that the big problem with LPMs is their linearity, right? It is the part of a regression that makes regression analysis so simple to understand, but also the part that breaks our probability model. We want to redesign our regression model to **resemble** a linear model, but stay within the $[0, 1]$ interval.\n",

Those are the slope parameters for a linear equation resulting in our prediction of the dependent variable (outcome). We typically refer to each coefficient as a $\\beta$ (beta) term, with subscripts ($\\beta_i$) denoting which coefficient we are referring to. If we use the same subscripts to describe our $x$ variables, then we can write our regression equation (with $k$ variables) as follows:\n",

    "The confusing part of logistic regression stems from understanding the difference between coefficients in linear regression and in logistic regression. In linear regression, a coefficient describes the change in the dependent variable resulting from a one unit **increase** in the independent variable associated with that coefficient. If, for example, the coefficient of age on income (in Euros) is &#128;1,000, then an individual would be expected to earn &#128;1,000 more if he or she were 1 year older, or &#128;1,000 less if he or she were 1 year younger.\n",

If the value is below 0, then the likelihood of success diminishes. The effects are not linear, but they do reflect the direction of the trend and can be interpreted to understand the relationship that each variable has with the outcome."
