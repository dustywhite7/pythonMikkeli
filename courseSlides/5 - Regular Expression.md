### Dealing with Text

How have you dealt with text in Python so far?

---

### Dealing with Text

How have you dealt with text in Python so far?

- Reading/Writing CSVs
- Test equality
- Passing arguments to functions
- Other ways?

---

### Dealing with Text

In the past, as we have dealt with text, we have needed to meet EXACT conditions in order for our programs to be able to function:

```python
>>> "mystring" == "MyString"
False
>>> [i for i in range(1000) if '4' in i]
```

If the exact condition is not met, then we cannot apply conditions based on this equality.

### Becoming More Flexible

Sometimes I survey my students before tests, and ask what score they expect to get (from 0 to 100%). How could I extract their number responses?

1) "I think I'll get a 50."
2) "47%"
3) "If I get a 60 I'm good."
4) "Don't know. Maybe 85."

Is there a good way to write Python code to catch all of these numbers?

---

### Becoming More Flexible

What if I have a form that asks for a phone number? How could I recognize valid US phone numbers among the following:

1) 425-389-1180
2) 3365-1328
2) 1-402-554-3303
3) 644-1428
4) 32-1845-9865
5) 846-16-9975

---

### Regular Expression

Regular Expression is a set of expressions through which we can describe the language that we are searching for. It is designed to find patterns in text, allowing for broad application of text conditions to data.

To use Regular Expression in Python,

```python
import re
```

We can work through examples in Mimir notebooks (or in Spyder or a terminal)

---


### Regular Expression

```python
mystring = "I think I'll get a 50."
```

Let's find the expected score in this response!

```python
re.search(r'[0123456789]', mystring)
```

- `r''` denotes a "raw" string, and permits escape characters. We will always put our regex code into raw strings

---


### Regular Expression

```python
mystring = "I think I'll get a 50."
```

Let's find the expected score in this response!

```python
re.search(r'[0123456789]', mystring)
```


- `[]` denotes a "character class", or all possible values of a character that we are looking for

- In this case, we declare that we are looking for a character taking the value of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9


---

### Regular Expression

```python
mystring = "I think I'll get a 50."
re.search(r'[0123456789]', mystring)
```

What is our output?

```python
<_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(19, 20), match='5'>
```

This is a "match object" generated by our search. It tells us 1) that we found a match, 2) the position of the match in the string, and 3) the string of the match itself

---

### Regular Expression

```python
mystring = "I think I'll get a 50."
re.search(r'[0123456789]', mystring)
```

What is our output?

```python
<_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(19, 20), match='5'>
```

Did our student report that they would score a 5%? NO!

What is wrong?



---

### Regular Expression

```python
mystring = "I think I'll get a 50."
re.search(r'[0123456789]', mystring)
```

This search looks for a **single character** that has a number value. We need more than one character:


---

### Regular Expression

```python
mystring = "I think I'll get a 50."
re.search(r'[0123456789]', mystring)
```

This search looks for a **single character** that has a number value. We need more than one character:

```python
re.search(r'[0123456789][0123456789]', mystring)
```

This search returns the following:
```python
<_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(19, 21), match='50'>
```


---

### Regular Expression

```python
mystring = "I think I'll get a 50."
re.search(r'[0123456789][0123456789]', mystring)
```

```python
<_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(19, 21), match='50'>
```

Great! We match 50. But what if the student **did** respond with 5%? Or what if they thought they would get 100%? Try our search on new responses:

- "I think I'll get a 5."
- "I think I'll get a 100."

---

### Regular Expression

```python
re.search(r'[0123456789][0123456789]', mystring)
```


- "I think I'll get a 5."

	- We get no result!


- "I think I'll get a 100."
	- Even worse, we get a BAD result!


<br>

What are all the possible numbers that are appropriate for our problem?


---


### Repeating Values

```python
re.search(r'[0-9]*', mystring)
```

This new search will look for any number of consecutive number characters between 0 and 9 (all digits)

```python
re.search(r'[0-9]+', mystring)
```

This search will look for **1 or more** digits between 0 and 9


---


### Repeating Values

- `*` is shorthand for 0 or more of a character/character class
- `+` is shorthand for 1 or more of a character/character class
- `?` is shorthand for 0 or 1 (like saying"maybe")
- `{x,y}` is shorthand for a character that is repeated no less than $x$ times, and no more than $y$ times

For percentages, we might want something like

```python
re.search(r'[0-9]{1,3}', mystring)
```

---

### Uncertainty

```python
mystring = "I think I'll get a 500."
re.search(r'[0-9]{1,3}', mystring)
```

If students provide bad percentages, our search will still return them.

- "I think I'll get a 500."
- "I think I'll get a 5000."
- "I think I'll get a 12976589."

What do we get back in these cases?

---

### Uncertainty

We can be more stringent in our expectations:

- A percentage with 3 digits can only begin with a 1! Two digit percentages shouldn't lead with a 0, and single digit percentages can be between 0 and 9.

<br>

```python
re.search(r'(100|[1-9][0-9]|[0-9])', mystring)
```


---


### Uncertainty


```python
re.search(r'(100|[1-9][0-9]|[0-9])', mystring)
```

Here, we use a new symbol: `|` (call it the "pipe")
- Pipes are used to denote options

What we are saying is that our result should be `100`, OR a number with the first digit between 1 and 9 and the second digit between 0 and 9, OR a single digit between 0 and 9.


---

### Uncertainty



```python
re.search(r'(100|[1-9][0-9]|[0-9])', mystring)
```

Are there still problems here?

---

### Uncertainty



```python
re.search(r'(100|[1-9][0-9]|[0-9])', mystring)
```

Are there still problems here?

Yes! We need to figure out why 
1) 5000 still matches and returns `50`
2) 500 does the same
3) 12976589 returns `12`

---

### Establishing Boundaries

We need symbols that represent the start or end of words:

- `\b` represents a word boundary (either at the start or end of a word
- `^` represents the start of a string
- `$` represents the end of a string


```python
re.search(r'(100|[1-9][0-9]|[0-9])', mystring)
```

What do we need to add to our expression?


---

### Establishing Boundaries

We can solve our number problem with word boundaries in this case:
```python
re.search(r'\b(100|[1-9][0-9]|[0-9])\b', mystring)
```


---

### Phone Numbers

How can we solve our phone number problem?

Take 5 minutes and try with your neighbors.
1) 425-389-1180
2) 3365-1328
2) 1-402-554-3303
3) 644-1428
4) 32-1845-9865
5) 846-16-9975


---

### Phone Numbers

How can we solve our phone number problem?

My solution:
```python
re.search(r'\b((1-)?\d{3}-)?(\d{3}-\d{4})\b', mystring)
```

<br>

But even here, I haven't included any way to account for phone numbers with `(` and `)` around the area code.

---

### Some Additional Shorthand

- `\w` - denotes any alphanumeric character, or an underscore (`[a-zA-Z0-9_]`)
- `\d` - denotes any numeric character (`[0-9]`)
- `\s` - denotes any whitespace character (`[ \t\n\r\f\v]`)
- `\W` - the inverse of `\w`
- `\D` - the inverse of `\d`
- `\S` - the inverse of `\s`


---

### City, State Combinations

What if we want to find city, state abbreviation combinations (ie Miami, FL) from a text address?

1) "6708 Pine Street, Omaha, NE 68182"
2) "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20006"
3) "261 S 800 E\nSalt Lake City, UT 84102"

<br>

Take 5 minutes to try it out. What shorthand might help?

---

### City, State Combinations

What if we want to find city, state abbreviation combinations (ie Miami, FL) from a text address?

```python
re.search(r'((\b\w+\b)+(\s)?){1,3}, ([A-Z]{2})', mystring)
```

1) "6708 Pine Street, Omaha, NE 68182"
2) "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20006"
3) "261 S 800 E\nSalt Lake City, UT 84102"

This code assumes that a city name will not consist of more than 3 words. (Dangerous assumption)

---

### City, State Combinations

What if we want to find city, state abbreviation combinations (ie Miami, FL) from a text address?

```python
myexp = r'(?:(?:\n|, )(.*)(?:, )([A-Z]{2}))'
```

This will get us what we want without the constraints on city name

What is going on, though?

---

### Groups

What is this statement doing?
```python
myexp = r'(?:(?:\n|, )(.*)(?:, )([A-Z]{2}))'
```
`(` and `)` allow us to denote **groups** in our expression

- We have one overarching group (the outer group)
- We have a series of inner groups, breaking our code into small segments

---

### Groups

What is this statement doing?
```python
myexp = r'(?:(?:\n|, )(.*)(?:, )([A-Z]{2}))'
```

Within our groups, we have a new, unique symbol: `?:`

- When used inside a group, this indicates that we do not care to capture the group
- This is useful when we change how we use the `re` library

---


### Finding All

1) "6708 Pine Street, Omaha, NE 68182"
2) "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20006"
3) "261 S 800 E\nSalt Lake City, UT 84102"

```python
myexp = r'(?:(?:\n|, )(.*)(?:, )([A-Z]{2}))'
re.findall(myexp, mystring)
```

Using those `?:` markers, we can omit all of the groups (and ugly separating characters) that we are not interested in collecting.

---


# Alternate Functionality

The `re` library offers several functions:
1) `re.search`: We can search as we have so far
2) `re.findall`: We can search for all matches in a string
3) `re.finditer`: We can generate an iterator to process all matches in a string (related to `findall`)
4) `re.split`: Use regex to split strings, rather than simple string matching


---

### Quick Iterations

With regular expression, you might want to try lots of things and fail quickly (over and over, because that is how learning works!).

[regexr.com](https://regexr.com) is a great place to put some sample data into a website and play around with regular expression
